	<h2> STRENGTH AND WEAKNESSES </h2>
	<img class="sidebarimage" src="sw.jpg">
        <p> My Strength and weaknesses in terms of IT field. Mostly when it comes to the IT field my weaknesses 
	overflow more than my strengths. Taking a course in BSIT without any experience is really hard especially 
	when it comes to coding. You need to memorize all the key words and try not to miss a single mistake if you 
	don’t want to ruin it.  My strength Patience is the key to success no matter how long the tutorials I always finish every last second and word of it. 
	So the weaknesses of mine will be filled by a lot of strengths when it comes to the IT field. </p>
